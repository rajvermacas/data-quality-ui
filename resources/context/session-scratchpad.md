- **Code Review**: Passed senior-level code review with APPROVED verdict

### Technical Implementation Details
1. **Heatmap Component** (`/src/components/features/Heatmap.tsx`):
   - Color-coded grid visualization using Tailwind CSS classes
   - Efficient data grouping by source-ruleType combinations
   - Interactive tooltips with detailed failure rate information
   - Responsive grid layout with proper overflow handling
   - Graceful empty state handling

2. **System Health Matrix** (`/src/components/features/SystemHealthMatrix.tsx`):
   - Health scoring algorithm: `(1 - failRate) * 100`
   - Four-tier status system: excellent (95%+), good (85%+), warning (70%+), critical (<70%)
   - Grid layout with systems as rows, dimensions as columns
   - Color-coded cells with health percentages and status labels
   - Comprehensive legend and accessibility features

3. **Chart Export Component** (`/src/components/ui/ChartExport.tsx`):
   - PNG export using html2canvas with high resolution (scale: 2)
   - SVG export with XML wrapper functionality
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Clean dropdown interface with format selection

4. **Dashboard View Switcher**:
   - Three-tab interface: ðŸ“ˆ Trend Analysis, ðŸ”¥ Heatmap, ðŸŽ¯ Health Matrix
   - Smooth transitions and active state styling
   - Maintains filter state across view changes
   - Clean integration with existing dashboard layout
