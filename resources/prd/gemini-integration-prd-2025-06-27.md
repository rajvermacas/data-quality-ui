# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Natural Language Query Integration with Google Gemini API

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 27, 2025  
**Product:** Data Quality Dashboard  
**Feature:** AI-Powered Natural Language Query Interface  

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the integration of Google Gemini API into the existing Data Quality Dashboard to enable users to generate dynamic visualizations through natural language queries. The feature will add an AI-powered query interface that analyzes user questions and generates contextual charts and graphs in real-time, significantly enhancing the dashboard's analytical capabilities and user experience.

The integration will create a separate section within the dashboard where users can ask questions like "Show me datasets with increasing failure rates in the last month" and receive custom visualizations tailored to their specific analytical needs.

2. **Limited Analytical Flexibility**: Users can only view data through predetermined visualization patterns
3. **Query Complexity**: Complex analytical questions require manual data exploration across multiple filters
4. **User Experience Gap**: Data analysts need to understand the existing filter system to extract insights
5. **Inflexible Reporting**: Custom analysis requires technical knowledge to modify chart configurations

### User Pain Points
