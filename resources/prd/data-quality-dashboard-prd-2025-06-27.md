# Data Quality Monitoring Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-06-27  
**Project:** Data Quality UI Dashboard  

## Executive Summary

The Data Quality Monitoring Dashboard is a Next.js web application designed to provide comprehensive visibility into data quality metrics across multiple systems and tenants. The dashboard focuses on trend analysis while providing flexible views for detailed investigation and operational monitoring.

## Problem Statement

Organizations need real-time visibility into data quality across multiple systems to:
- Identify declining data quality trends before they impact business operations
- Monitor compliance with data validation rules across different systems
- Provide stakeholders with actionable insights for data quality improvement
- Enable quick identification and resolution of data quality issues

## Objectives and Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives
- Provide trend-focused data quality monitoring with immediate visibility to declining metrics
- Enable dataset-specific analysis and historical trend tracking
- Support multi-tenant data quality oversight across various source systems
- Facilitate export capabilities for reporting and compliance needs

### Success Metrics
- Users can identify data quality issues within 30 seconds of dashboard load
- 100% of declining trends (red flags) are visible in the urgent attention widget
- Dashboard supports real-time filtering across all data dimensions
- Export functionality covers all filtered views and visualizations

## User Stories and Use Cases

### Primary User Stories

**US-001: Trend Monitoring**
- As a data quality manager, I want to see comparative trends (1m, 3m, 12m) as the default view so I can quickly identify quality degradation patterns

**US-002: Red Flag Identification**
- As a data operations team member, I want an urgent attention widget highlighting datasets with declining trends in the last month so I can prioritize remediation efforts

**US-003: Dataset Deep Dive**
- As a data analyst, I want to drill down into specific datasets to view historical trends and understand quality patterns over time

**US-004: Flexible Analysis**
- As a business stakeholder, I want to filter data by system, tenant, rule type, and time period to analyze quality from different perspectives

**US-005: Export and Sharing**
- As a compliance officer, I want to export filtered dashboard views to create reports for audits and stakeholder communications
