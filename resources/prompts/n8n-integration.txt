I have a new feature to develop.
I need to call the below api and wait for the response.
Here is what it does:
It is the url of an n8n.io workflow where I have already created the workflow. It does the following:
1. Take the input from message
2. call gemini flash llm to prepare a gitlab issue format with the content in the input.
3. creates the gitlab issue 
4. Sends a mail 
5. returns the response saying workflow is completed and here is the gitlab url for the issue.

Below is the curl command:
curl -X POST https://aibard.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/data-quality \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "message": "There is an increase in the HR system failure rate percentage by 34%. Assign it to aibardchatgpt17@gmail.com"
    }'

Below is the response:
{"workflowStatus":"completed","issueWebUrl":"https://gitlab.com/my-group-name2452611/data-quality/-/issues/12"}


Here is the requiremnet of the feature I want to you develop:
1. In the AI Query Assistant section there should be a but which should say something like create Issue.
2. Once this button is clicked, the user should be able to provide his input in plain natural language.
3. this input should be sent to the n8n api in the message body parameter.
4. Once you receive the response you should send an acknowledgement to the user that its created.
5. Also share the gitlab issue url so that the user can navigate and see the issue. 
6. Design it in a professional UI developer.
