## 🚀 MVP Definition & Rationale

### Core Problem
Organizations struggle with **reactive data quality management** - they only discover issues after business impact occurs. The primary pain point is the lack of **immediate visibility into declining data quality trends** across multiple systems.

### Essential MVP Features
The MVP addresses this core problem with minimal but functional capabilities:

1. **CSV Data Loading**: Process the existing full_summary.csv file
2. **Trend Visualization**: Basic comparative charts showing 1m vs 3m vs 12m failure rates
3. **Red Flag Detection**: Automatic identification of datasets with declining 1-month trends
4. **Urgent Attention Widget**: Prominent display of critical issues requiring immediate action
5. **Basic Filtering**: Essential filters for system and rule type
6. **Simple Export**: CSV export of filtered data for reporting

### Success Metrics for MVP
- ✅ Dashboard loads within 3 seconds with full dataset
- ✅ Users can identify declining trends within 30 seconds
- ✅ 100% of red-flag datasets visible in urgent attention widget
- ✅ Basic filtering works for system and rule type dimensions
- ✅ CSV export functionality operates correctly

### User Persona (Primary Target)
**Data Quality Manager**: Needs to quickly identify and prioritize data quality issues across multiple systems. Spends 15-30 minutes daily reviewing data quality status and requires clear visual indicators of declining trends.
